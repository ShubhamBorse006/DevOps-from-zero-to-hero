Networking is a core skill for every software engineer. This blog explains essential networking concepts like TCP ,UDP, HTTP ,HTTPS, network connections, and network types in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

Hey there, tech enthusiasts! If you’re new to the world of computer networking, you’ve come to the right place. Let’s dive into the basics and get you up to speed.

Networking is the backbone of modern Software engineering. Whether you’re deploying apps on cloud, managing containers, or setting up CI/CD pipelines, understanding how data moves across networks helps you debug, secure, and optimize systems faster.

Computers communicate over the internet using some basic protocols or rules defined by the internet society. The most common ones are TCP, UDP, and HTTP.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): This protocol ensures that all data sent over the internet reaches the client in its entirety. Think of it as a reliable delivery service. Examples include FTP and SMTP.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Unlike TCP, UDP doesn’t guarantee that all data will reach the client. It’s a connection-less protocol, meaning it doesn’t establish a connection before sending data. This is often used in gaming and streaming.

HTTP / HTTPS — How the Web Works

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
The language browsers use to ask for webpages.

HTTPS:
Same as HTTP, but secure — the data is encrypted so others can’t read it. This protocol relates to the format of data transferred over the internet. For example, https://www.google.com.

Data transfers in packets!

When data is too large, the internet breaks it into smaller chunks called packets.

Want to know the IP address of your device and your internet provider? Just use this command:

# curl ifconfig.me -s

Types of Internet Network Connections: There are two main types of internet network connections:

Physical connections: Networks connected by physical cables, such as cables, fiber optics, and coaxial cables.

Wireless connections: Networks transmitted wirelessly through the air, like Bluetooth, WiFi, 3G, 4G, and 5G.

🕸 Types of Networks

LAN (Local Area Network):
Covers a small area (home, office). Devices talk quickly because they’re close.

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):
Bigger than LAN — think a city or large campus.

WAN (Wide Area Network):
Very big networks — across cities or countries. The Internet is the biggest WAN.

So, LAN < MAN < WAN in size and scope.

And there you have it! Understanding these basics will help you navigate the digital world with confidence. Happy networking!
